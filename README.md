Title: Temperature Monitoring and Alarm System
Purpose: Detects ambient temperature and provides visual and audible warning above a threshold.
Components:
Arduino UNO
LM35 sensor
LCD 1602 (16x2)
LED + buzzer
Operation:
Measures temperature
Displays on LCD
If it exceeds 27°C → LED + buzzer ON
What I learned:
Reading analog sensors
Controlling LCD 1602 in 4-bit mode
Contrast adjustment, ADC references
Software filtering and output control
